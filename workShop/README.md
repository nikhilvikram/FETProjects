Hearing this captain was uncolably peeking from as many angle as possible to guage a route in order to alert the troops .
The guard returned with a bad news , he expressed how riots members are spreaded in the whole area , but there is chance of bypassing the horse-hoisted riots the way some coustomers are excavating through back garden.
Captaine sat on chair and was calculating the situation and the he rose up jerkingly giving orders for me to stay with one guard and he will alert the troops , the bar owner and me hesiteted to allow this plan but he was sure of his decision , we hugged and shaked hand and prayed for best outcome . and the captain tookoff with one of the guard   .
