Title  6 :Aftermath of the standoff
Captain ran towards the trrops making an large arc centric to the riots assembly , but he got wounded in his legs by the riots , seeing 
this other soldiers made movement towards the captai and the fight broke out , now the most important task was to abandon the british imperial badges and uniform ,
as my first guess was that this riots would be an arch enemy of our kind , ,
We were out of our dress in no time , we were unaware of the scenario that was hapenning outside , when riots were busty in fight a group of them caught us staring through the window 
and started throwing rocks on us , suddenly there was a big laud blast in downstairs , they broke the door , the creepling and begging sound painted a picture like 
a masacre of remaining coustumers downstairs was happening , there were four other people above bar with Naman , a 17 year old servent , bar owner and his wife and one guard.
Naman sought out whatever stuff that can be used for fighting , and handed to three of them and asked them to hide behind the closet .
On taking a look naman found that there were 3 of them armed with rifle and swords , they just killed two coustumers downstairs and heavily injured one of them ,
just as they were gauging the room annd sighting for stairs Naman hid behind the closet with one riffle loaded and weilding one knife in a hand , the guard signalled not to shoot 
as it will alert other riots to their location . so we planned to grab each riot and slit their lower throat whilst supressing their vocal chord , we posisioned ourself and shortly we 
heard the footstep approaching towards us , the guard was all set to suffuse his move , but i had my heart racing at threashould , soon they arrived at the entrance and we both grabbed each one , the guard executed 
one riot swiftly , i holded the riot suffocating his and started slitting his throat , midway there i cut my hand left the riot loose the guard abrubtly charged towards me , with the eyes of a 
natural predetor and stabbed the riot repeatedly i was in absolute shock , after he confirmed bot riot were killed he charged towrda me and grabbed my injured palm 
and asked the bar owner for alcohal or any septic first aid he ran towards the closset in silence , searching the closet like he had a knife dangling on his throat , 
finally he found the first aid kit with herbs and alcohal , for 10 minutes there was heavy silence not a single sound from the room , but the aggresive sound from the steet was arousing minute
by minute , while finishing the band-aid on my palm the guard peeked from the window and made projection that riots are still huge in number both live and dead bodies .
The best chance of our survival is to make an escape from here , the guard was like the alpha male there who took down two riots and cared my wound , whatever suggestion he would project that would be of 
utmost priority.
The bar owner asked his servent and wife to pack all stuff necesary for travel , and he went downstairs to lock the door we scanned the room quickly and grabbed whatever seemed worthy , 

We were ready to depart as the bar owner came upstairs , grabbed his tobbaco and liquir and nothing for survival . he signalled us to go onthe same back exit the captain went , 
but instead of walking in arch we headed to the opposite direction as the fight broke out , we had huge luggage with us as the guard predicted the most safe place to hide is , geting lost in jungle for few days 

We walked for about 2 kilometres from the bar , and we located a farm loaded with haystack , few cattles and horses , the owner asked us to unload stuff from the chariot and pointed
and 3 cases and asked us to load them on chariot the cases were too heavy , like almost filled with rocks and metal . me and the guard were at sighn of releif that these cases would increase
our chance of survival .within 10 minuutes we set off to the jungle route , the bar owner was managing the navigation and the guard was the driver of chariout whiel we three were at back of the 
chariout , we travelled 10 more kilometers and we were already entering in dense jungle
